# RL Profit Maximization

This is a Python implementation of Thompson Sampling and Uniform Sampling methods for selecting the best advertising campaign to maximize profit.

## Environment

There are 8 advertising campaigns to choose from, and we simulate 10 million customers.

For each campaign, we generate a random conversion rate (between 1% and 20%), a random average profit per sale (between $100 and $200), and initialize sales and no-sales counts.

## Class

We define a class Advertising_Campaign to encapsulate the characteristics of a campaign, and implement the following methods:

__init__(self, campaign_id): initialize the campaign with a unique ID, a random conversion rate, a random average profit per sale, and sales and no-sales counts.
total_trials(self): returns the total number of trials (sales + no-sales).
total_profit(self): returns the total profit generated by the campaign.
actual_profit_per_trial(self): returns the actual profit per trial (total profit / total trials).
expected_profit_per_trial(self): returns the expected profit per trial (conversion rate * average profit per sale).
We also define a function try_campaign(campaign) that takes a campaign object and tries it on a customer. If the customer converts, we increment the campaign's sales count. Otherwise, we increment the no-sales count.

## Thompson Sampling

For each customer, we calculate the beta value for each campaign using the current actual profit per trial and the number of trials so far. We then select the campaign with the highest beta value to try on the customer. After trying the campaign, we update its sales and no-sales counts.

## Uniform Sampling

We use a naive uniform sampling approach to compare against Thompson Sampling. For each campaign, we calculate the expected profit per customer (conversion rate * average profit per sale) and multiply it by the number of customers (10 million / 8) to get the expected total profit. We then add up the profits for each campaign to get the total profit.

## Results

We compare the total profit generated by Thompson Sampling and Uniform Sampling, as well as the absolute and relative improvement of Thompson Sampling over Uniform Sampling.
